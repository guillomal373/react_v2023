Technologies:
1- Expo: Provides Tools to build your app more easily. (Pre-Built Components)
 - Expo Router (file-based)

2- React Native (JavaScript)
 - Rendering react native components
  Example of Interactive Components:
   - TouchableOpacity   -> button
   - ActivityIndicator  -> Spinner/Loading
   - Flatlist           -> Render long list of items with scroll (like map on react) LARGER
   - Map Function       ->SMALL LIST
   - ScrollView         -> like overflow in HTML, to easy explore any item on the list
   - SafeAreaView       -> safe zone to display all the data of my app
